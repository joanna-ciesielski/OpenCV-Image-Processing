# OpenCV-Image-Processing

Overview

This project demonstrates the use of OpenCV, a popular open-source computer vision library, to perform various image processing tasks. The aim is to showcase how OpenCV can be leveraged for fundamental operations like edge detection, image filtering, and object recognition. The project is designed as a learning tool for understanding basic concepts in computer vision and image analysis.

Features

    Image Preprocessing: Includes resizing, color conversion (grayscale, RGB, etc.), and normalization.
    Edge Detection: Implements edge detection using algorithms like Canny and Sobel.
    Image Filtering: Demonstrates image blurring and sharpening techniques using convolutional filters.
    Object Detection: Basic object detection using contours and thresholding.
    Image Segmentation: Includes techniques for segmenting images into distinct regions.

Technologies Used

    Python: Programming language used for the implementation.
    OpenCV: Main library used for computer vision tasks.
    NumPy: For numerical operations and image manipulation.
    Matplotlib: Used for displaying images and visualizing the results.
